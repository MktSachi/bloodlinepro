            <p>Blood groups are classified based on the presence or absence of 
            specific antigens on the surface of red blood cells. These antigens 
            can trigger immune responses if transfused into someone with a 
            different blood type, making understanding blood groups critical for 
            safe blood transfusions and organ transplants.</p>

            <h2>Main Blood Group System</h2>
            <h3>ABO Blood Group System</h3>
            <p>The ABO system is the most important blood group system in transfusion medicine.
                ABO blood Group system there are two antigens known as A antigen and  B antigen 
                and they give rise to following blood groups.</p>

            <h3>Genetics in blood type inheritance</h3>
            <p>Genetics determines blood type compatibility for transfusions and organ transplants, 
                and advances in genetic research improve the safety and efficacy of these medical procedures.</p>

            <h3>Where there is an antigen there should be an antibody</h3>
            <p>The immune system recognizes foreign antigens on invading pathogens, producing antibodies
                to neutralize them. Immunization enhances antibody production preemptively. Interestingly, 
                the immune system refrains from producing antibodies against antigens inherited on red cells, 
                leading to the production of A and B antibodies against similar structures encountered
                in daily life.</p>

            <p>The prevalence of blood groups varies significantly among different 
                populations worldwide, shaping the landscape of transfusion medicine 
                and impacting medical practices globally. Understanding the distribution 
                of blood types is not only crucial for effective blood transfusions 
                but also holds significance in fields such as anthropology, genetics, 
                and public health. By examining the prevalence of blood groups across 
                diverse ethnicities and regions, we gain insight into the intricate 
                interplay between genetics, environment, and human evolution. This 
                introductory exploration sets the stage for a deeper understanding 
                of the complexities and implications of blood group prevalence on a
                global scale.</p>

            <h2>Compatibility Of Blood Donor And Recipient</h2>
            <p>During a blood transfusion red blood cells obtained from a donor is 
                given to a vein (a blood vessel that carry blood towards the heart)
                of the patient or recipient through a blood transfusion set. After
                the transfusion the donor’s red cells dissolves in the recipient’s
                plasma and circulates all over the recipient’s body. Since our 
                immune system is on constant surveillance on the foreign substances
                entering into the blood circulation transfused red cells are also 
                subjected to this surveillance. The immuno-globulins or antibodies
                in the recipient’s plasma would react against the antigens of donor
                red cells if they contain a foreign antigen.</p> 
        
            <p><b>For example : </b>Group A
                blood cannot be given to a group B patient since antigen A on donor
                red cells reacts with A antibody in the recipients plasma giving 
                rise to a transfusion reaction. Furthermore, prior to a safe 
                transfusion we must consider about the antigen on donor’s red
                cells and antibodies in the recipient’s plasma. In the transfusion
                laboratory this is determined by a compatibility testing. Compatible
                donors and recipients are marked in the following table,</p>
