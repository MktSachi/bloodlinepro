        <h2>The Evolution of Blood Transfusion: A Journey Through Time</h2>
        <p>Blood is a vital fluid that circulates throughout the body, delivering essential 
        substances like oxygen and nutrients to cells while also removing waste products. </p>
  
        <p>The story begins in 1628 with William Harvey, 
        the first physician to describe the circulation of blood in the human body.
        His groundbreaking work laid the foundation for future advances in blood transfusion. 
        A few decades later, in 1665, Dr. Richard Lower performed the first successful blood 
        transfusion using dogs as both the donor and recipient.This pioneering experiment 
        set the stage for further exploration into the potential of transfusions.</p>  
        
        <p>Despite the initial success in animals, early human blood transfusions were fraught 
        with challenges. Many patients died after receiving transfusions, and the reason 
        remained a mystery until 1900. It was in this year that Dr. Karl Landsteiner made 
        a monumental discovery: the ABO blood group system. Landsteiner identified four main 
        blood types—O, A, B, and AB—and recognized the importance of matching blood types 
        between donors and recipients. His work earned him the Nobel Prize and revolutionized
        the field of blood transfusion.</p>

        <h2>The Development of Blood Services</h2>
        <p>In 1946, the Blood Transfusion Service was established 
            to manage and facilitate blood donations. This was followed 
            by the formation of the National Blood Service in 1950, 
            specifically tasked with collecting and providing blood supplies 
            to hospitals across Sri Lanka. These organizations have played a 
            crucial role in ensuring a steady and safe supply of blood for medical use.</p>
    
        <h2>Blood Components and Shelf Life</h2>
        <p>Blood is a complex substance composed of several key components: red cells, 
            white cells, platelets, and plasma. Each component has a specific function
            and shelf life. For instance, red cells, essential for transporting oxygen,
            can be stored for 35 to 42 days. Platelets, which are crucial for blood clotting,
            have a much shorter shelf life of only five days. This limited storage time 
            underscores the constant need for fresh blood donations.</p>

        <h2>Blood Donation: Who Can Donate?</h2>
        <p>Almost anyone between the ages of 18 and 55 can become a new blood donor, 
            with regular donors able to continue until the age of 60. Blood donation 
            is a simple yet profoundly impactful act that can save lives. Given that 
            the average adult has about 5 trillion red blood cells per liter of blood, 
            and approximately 25 trillion red cells in total, the human body is well-equipped 
            to regenerate the donated blood.</p>

        <h2>The Lifespan of Red Blood Cells</h2>
        <p>Interestingly, the human body continuously renews its blood supply. 
            Approximately 25 million red blood cells, or 0.1% of the total, die 
            day. This amounts to roughly 300 red blood cells per second. The body’s 
            remarkable ability to replenish these cells ensures that regular blood 
            donation does not adversely affect the donor’s health.</p>
