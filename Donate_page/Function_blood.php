    <p style="text-align:justify">Blood is the life-sustaining fluid of the body, essential for transportation, 
        regulation, and protection. Its multifaceted roles ensure that our body functions 
        efficiently, remains in balance, and is safeguarded against infections and injuries.</p>

    <h2>The Lifespan of Red Blood Cells</h2>
    <p>Interestingly, the human body continuously renews its blood supply. 
        Approximately 25 million red blood cells, or 0.1% of the total, die 
        day. This amounts to roughly 300 red blood cells per second. The body’s 
        remarkable ability to replenish these cells ensures that regular blood 
        donation does not adversely affect the donor’s health.</p>

       <h2> Maintenance of Blood Volume and Pressure:</h2>
    
        <p>   Blood plays a crucial role in maintaining adequate blood volume and blood pressure, 
          which are essential for ensuring proper circulation and perfusion of tissues.</p>
        <p>Blood volume is regulated by mechanisms such as fluid intake, fluid absorption in 
          the gastrointestinal tract, and fluid excretion by the kidneys.</p>
        <p>Blood pressure is regulated by various factors, including cardiac output
           (the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute) and peripheral vascular
            resistance (the resistance to blood flow in the blood vessels).</p>
        <p>The composition of blood, including its cellular components (red blood cells, white blood
           cells, platelets) and plasma (water, proteins, electrolytes), contributes to its osmolarity
            and viscosity, which influence blood pressure and flow dynamics</p>
        <p>Hormonal regulation, such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the secretion 
          of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by the pituitary gland, helps maintain blood pressure and
           volume by regulating fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and blood vessel constriction or dilation.</p>
        <p>Disorders such as dehydration, hypovolemia (low blood volume), and hypotension (low blood pressure) 
          can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and impair organ function, highlighting the importance 
          of blood in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis.</p>

            <h2>A. Transportation</h2>
                <p>1. Respiratory Gases</p>
                  <p>Blood transports oxygen from the lungs to the body's cells, binding
                        it to hemoglobin in red blood cells. It also carries carbon dioxide, 
                        a waste product of cellular metabolism, back to the lungs for exhalation.</p>

                <p>2. Nutrients</p>
                   <p>Nutrients like glucose, amino acids, fatty acids,
                        vitamins, and minerals, absorbed from the digestive tract, 
                        are distributed throughout the body by the blood.</p>
                        <img src="image/nutrients.jpg" alt="Nutrients" height="25%" width="25%">      
         
    
                <p>3. Waste Products</p>
                   <p>Blood removes waste products such as urea and ammonia by
                        transporting them to the kidneys for excretion as urine.
                        It also carries carbon dioxide to the lungs for elimination.</p>

                 <p>4. Other Substances</p>
                    
                    <p>Blood is essential for delivering various substances within the body.
                        Medications and hormones, after entering the bloodstream, reach their 
                        specific targets through blood circulation.</p>

            <h2>B. Regulation</h2>
                <p>1. Homeostasis</p>
                      <p>Blood plays a vital role in maintaining stable internal conditions, known as homeostasis. It helps regulate:
                        <p> - Body Temperature: Distributes heat throughout the body.</p>
                        <p> - pH Balance: Maintains acid-base balance.</p>
                        <p> - Blood Pressure: Ensures consistent blood flow and pressure.</p>

                    </p>
                    
                    
            <h2>C. Protection</h2>
                <p>1. Immune Defense</p>
                <p>White blood cells in the blood protect against infections by engulfing pathogens 
                        through phagocytosis. Antibodies and antitoxins in the blood also neutralize harmful microbes.</p>

                <p>2. Blood Clotting</p>
                    <p>Blood prevents excessive bleeding by forming clots. Platelets and clotting factors work
                        together to seal wounds and stop bleeding.</p>
